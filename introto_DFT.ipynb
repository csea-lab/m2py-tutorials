This dot product should look like the real part (the cosine component) of the DFT. The dot product can be thought of as a correlation between a template and the data. It has a greater value when the data happen to look like the template (here, sine and cosine functions at different frequencies) and a lower value when template and data are differentlin time course.

    "# Just like for the built-in DFT algorith,m we now calculate the amplitude spectrum by taking the modulus (absolute value) of the sine and cosine dotproducts. The absolute value for each frequency is simply the square root of the sum of the squares of the cosine dot product and sine dot products. Note that the resulting spectrum is very similar to the built-in DFT (FFT) function that matlab uses. Small differences are owed to slight difference in implementation in the buil-in algorithm. This concludes this demo. The goal is for you now have a better intuition of the inner workings of DFT/FFT algorithms applied, as they can be thought of as a frequency-wise application of sine and cosine filters to the data. There are a few more interesting aspects, including how the length (duration) of the time segment affects the DFT. There is a demo on that in this collection (introto_DFTuncertainty.mlx).
