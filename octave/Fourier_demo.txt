# Fourier walkthrough with visualization
# This live script walks you through the steps of discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and illustrates some of the principles that help or hinder the application of DFT in EEG analysis, inlcuding practical application
# The goal of FFT is to take time domain data (EEG over time) and give you a frequency spectrum (Frequency domain data), i.e. a plot where frequency is on the x and the power or magnitude at each frequency is on the y-axis.

# Raw magnitude at each frequency is the modulus (sqrt if the sum of the squares) of the two parts (real and imag). So, the length of the arrow spanned by the real and imag part in the plot above. 
# Phase is the angle between real and imaginary (see above)

# Note how this spectrum is symmetrical. This is because of this: 
# ![image.png](attachment:image.png)
# This is called the Nyquist sampling theorem. If you sample a signal digitally, any frequencies greater than half the sampling rate are meaningless repetitions of the actual ones below half the sampling rate. half the sampling rate = Nyquist frequency. 
# if we apply the logic from the slides of Day 1, namely that the frequency resolution (the steps between x-ticks or bins) is 1000/length of the signal, it follows that the frequency steps here are 1000/(2551.*2) = 0.1960. Thus, 

# %%



# %% [matlab]
# freq_axis  = 0:1000/(length(data).*2):SampRate-1000/(length(data).*2); % sample rate is 500 Hz, so each sample point has 2 ms	
# figure, plot(freq_axis, RawMag), xlabel('Frequency in Hz'), ylabel('Unscaled power (integral)'), title('Power density plot')

# %% [markdown]
# Because of the Nyquist theorem, we may really only interpret the spectrum up onto half of the sampling rate, here in this example up to 250 Hz, the rest of the spectrum (above 250 Hz) is not valid. Below, we take this into account as we calculate the power. But first, power is overall greater when the signal is longer. This is bad when wanting to compare spectra from different studies, or different EEG segments, with different length. Below, we see how less data result in smaller power.

### Congrats! this is a valid FFT/DFT. For some applications, this version with no windowing and no averaging within the time segment is best. 
## Part 2: improving the signal-to noise of the estimate. 

# The spectrum on the right is noisy looking and has higher frequency resolution (many x-ticks) than we might want. Instead we woudl like a clear shape and nice signal. In Matlab and most other enviornments, people often use a version of Welch's method, where a window is moved over the signal, DFTs are calculated, and averaged as they are moved. In matlab here is how this works, all in one command: 

# `[Pxx,F] = pwelch(X,WINDOW,NOVERLAP,F,Fs)`

# %%



# %% [matlab]
[Pxx,F] = pwelch(data,500,[],500,SampRate); % 50% OOVERLAP is the default
subplot(2,1,1), plot(freq_axis(1:200), spec(1:200)), xlabel('Frequency in Hz'), ylabel('Scaled power (density, µV^2/Hz)'), title('Normalized power density plot')
subplot(2,1,2), plot(F(1:40), Pxx(1:40)), xlabel('Frequency in Hz'), ylabel('Scaled power (density, µV^2/Hz)'), title('Welch spectrum')

# %% [markdown]
# Note how the welch spectrum has fewer frequency steps because we used many shorter segments within our data segment, did a spectrum, and averaged the resulting spectra together, to obtain a much smmother, high signal-to-noise version. 

# ----

# Finally, windows are also sometimes useful, even without averaging, because they minimize/attenuate on and offset artifacts. The sine and cosine functions that the DFT uses as models for the data are infinite and stationary (see slides), thus they create artfifacts at the beginning and end of the signal.

RawMagwindowed = abs(fftwindowed);
Magwindowed = RawMagwindowed.*2; % multiply by two, then use only lower half
MaMagwindowed(1) = Magwindowed(1)/2; % the first value (zero Hz) was not symmetric, so no correction here. 
Magwindowed = Magwindowed/NFFT; % scale by the number of points, so we can compare long and short segments etc
specwindowed = Magwindowed(1:round(NFFT./2)); % take only lower half of the spectrum and plot it

# %% [markdown]
# Note the smaller value at 0 (zero) Hz in the windowed version, and its overall smoother look. Sometimes windowing is beneficial because of these effects. Also note the overall smaller/lower power in the windowed version. If no window is necessarym this is an undesirabel effect of using unneeded windows.
